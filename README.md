# 📉 Customer Churn Prediction (Machine Learning)

This project uses classical machine learning techniques to predict customer churn based on historical customer behavior data.

## 📌 Objective
Build a predictive model that identifies customers who are likely to churn, allowing businesses to proactively retain them.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python, pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, KNN)
- Seaborn, Matplotlib (EDA & Visualization)

## 🧠 ML Workflow
- Data Preprocessing
- EDA (Correlations, Churn Trends)
- Feature Selection & Scaling
- Model Training & Evaluation (Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, ROC-AUC)

## ✅ Outcome
Achieved ~82% accuracy using Random Forest. The model was validated using train-test split and evaluated on multiple metrics.

## 📁 Structure
- `CustomerChurn_Prediction_project_ML.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing full implementation
- Dataset: `customer_churn.csv`
